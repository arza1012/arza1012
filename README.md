### Hi there 👋


- 👩🏽‍💻 I’m a medical doctor by training, that felt in love with the ability to make things happen.

- 🧠 My journey into programming began with an intensive JavaScript program that provided me with a solid foundation. The hunger for learning didn't stop there. I'm always eager to continue learning and expanding my skill set in this ever-evolving field.

- 🌱 Currently, I'm part of a dynamic team at an innovative geospatial company. We specialize in providing cloud-based solutions, enabling geospatial teams to easily launch, process, and scale their algorithms in the cloud.
